satchwerk portfolio using threeJS

I built this portfolio from the three-js journey lesson taught by Bruno Simon

I've been learning three.js for almost two years and have finally deployed a portfolio page using it.
This lesson includes three.js as well as React Three Fiber. Inside the laptop, you will find my githubio page.
It uses HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 5.3

I'm proud of what I have achieved.
